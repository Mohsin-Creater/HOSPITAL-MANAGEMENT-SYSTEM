Hospital Management System

Project Description: 
The Hospital Management System is a simple C++ project designed to manage patient records and diagnosis information. It helps hospitals maintain basic patient details efficiently and ensures a straightforward way to access information. The system includes a secure login process to restrict access, ensuring only authorized users can manage or view patient data.

Objectives:
1- Patient Record Management: Store and retrieve detailed information about patients, such as name, address, contact number, age, sex, blood group, and medical history.
2- Diagnosis Information: Record additional medical details, such as symptoms, diagnosis, prescribed medicines, admission status, and ward type.
3- Data Security: Implement a basic login system to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive patient information.
4- Hospital Information: Provide general information about the hospital from a predefined text file.
5- Basic File Handling: Focus on adding and retrieving data stored in files, simulating a small database.

Features:
1- Secure Login System: Users must enter the correct password to gain access to the program.
2- Add Patient Records: Users can create new patient records by entering personal and medical details.
3- Add Diagnosis Information: Users can update the patient file with symptoms, diagnosis, medicines, and other medical details.
4- View Patient History: Allows users to review all recorded information about a patient.
5- Hospital Details: Displays general information about the hospital from a predefined file.
6- File Management: Records are stored in external text files, allowing for easy retrieval. Deleting records requires manual removal of files from the project folder.

Instructions for Running the Program:

1- Compilation:
Use any C++ compiler, such as Dev-C++, Turbo C++, or GCC, to compile the program.
Save all files, including hos.txt (hospital information file), in the same directory as the executable.

2- Execution:
Run the compiled program in Full-Screen Mode to ensure the layout and design are displayed correctly.
Enter the password ("pass") when prompted to access the system. The program will not proceed without successful authentication.

3- Menu Options:
Add New Patient Record: Choose this option to create a new file for a patient and input their details.
Add Diagnosis Information: Select an existing patient file to add further medical information.
Full History of the Patient: View all details about a specific patient from their file.
Information About the Hospital: Displays predefined information about the hospital stored in the file hos.txt.
Exit the Program: Terminates the application safely.

4- File Management:
Patient records are saved as text files in the project directory. To delete a record, locate the corresponding file and remove it manually.
Ensure the hospital information file (hos.txt) is updated for accurate hospital details.


Note:
1- This system is a mini project with limited functionality, focusing on basic file handling and information storage.
2- Ensure Full-Screen Mode while running the program, as the layout is optimized for larger screens. Running in smaller windows may distort the design and alignment.
