Project Description: Hospital Management System
The Hospital Management System is a simple C++ project designed to manage patient records and diagnosis information. It helps hospitals maintain basic patient details efficiently and ensures a straightforward way to access information. The system includes a secure login process to restrict access, ensuring only authorized users can manage or view patient data.

Objectives:
Patient Record Management: Store and retrieve detailed information about patients, such as name, address, contact number, age, sex, blood group, and medical history.
Diagnosis Information: Record additional medical details, such as symptoms, diagnosis, prescribed medicines, admission status, and ward type.
Data Security: Implement a basic login system to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive patient information.
Hospital Information: Provide general information about the hospital from a predefined text file.
Basic File Handling: Focus on adding and retrieving data stored in files, simulating a small database.
Features:
Secure Login System: Users must enter the correct password to gain access to the program.
Add Patient Records: Users can create new patient records by entering personal and medical details.
Add Diagnosis Information: Users can update the patient file with symptoms, diagnosis, medicines, and other medical details.
View Patient History: Allows users to review all recorded information about a patient.
Hospital Details: Displays general information about the hospital from a predefined file.
File Management: Records are stored in external text files, allowing for easy retrieval. Deleting records requires manual removal of files from the project folder.
Instructions for Running the Program:
Compilation:

Use any C++ compiler, such as Dev-C++, Turbo C++, or GCC, to compile the program.
Save all files, including hos.txt (hospital information file), in the same directory as the executable.
Execution:

Run the compiled program in Full-Screen Mode to ensure the layout and design are displayed correctly.
Enter the password ("pass") when prompted to access the system. The program will not proceed without successful authentication.
Menu Options:

Add New Patient Record: Choose this option to create a new file for a patient and input their details.
Add Diagnosis Information: Select an existing patient file to add further medical information.
Full History of the Patient: View all details about a specific patient from their file.
Information About the Hospital: Displays predefined information about the hospital stored in the file hos.txt.
Exit the Program: Terminates the application safely.
File Management:

Patient records are saved as text files in the project directory. To delete a record, locate the corresponding file and remove it manually.
Ensure the hospital information file (hos.txt) is updated for accurate hospital details.
Note:
This system is a mini project with limited functionality, focusing on basic file handling and information storage.
Ensure Full-Screen Mode while running the program, as the layout is optimized for larger screens. Running in smaller windows may distort the design and alignment.
